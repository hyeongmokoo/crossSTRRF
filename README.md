# A Cross-Space-Time Relative Risk Function
This repository provides a sample code for a cross-space-time relative risk function (cross-STRRF), which helps to identify spatio-temporal locations that experience statistically significant changes in their density of events. 
The related article for a cross-STRRF will be available soon.
