# A Cross-Space-Time Relative Risk Function
This repository provides a sample code for a cross-space-time relative risk function (cross-STRRF), which helps to identify spatio-temporal locations that experience statistically significant changes in their density of events. 

The reference for the cross STRRF appears in [Koo et al. (2019)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15230406.2019.1641149).
